# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
This data science project focuses on **predicting house prices** using a dataset containing various features and attributes related to residential properties.  
By analyzing and modeling the data, the project aims to develop a **predictive model** that can estimate the sale prices of houses accurately.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project consists of detailed information about **residential properties**, including:

- 🏠 Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- 📏 Total square footage of living area  
- 📍 Location and neighborhood characteristics  
- 🧱 Construction quality and year built  
- 🚗 Garage capacity, lot size, and other property features  

These features collectively influence the **market price** of a house. The dataset is ideal for regression-based prediction tasks.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The **main objective** of this project is to use **machine learning techniques** to build a **robust predictive model** for house price estimation.

By training the model on **historical housing data**, we aim to:
- Identify key factors affecting house prices  
- Predict the sale price of unseen properties  
- Deliver accurate and reliable price estimations  

---

## 🧠 Approach

The project follows the standard **data science workflow**:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing and inconsistent data  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features  
- Removing outliers and irrelevant columns  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing relationships between features and price  
- Correlation analysis to find impactful attributes  
- Distribution plots to understand feature behavior  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creating new derived features (e.g., house age, total rooms)  
- Selecting important features using statistical and model-based methods  

### 4. Model Development
- Training multiple regression algorithms such as:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Regressor**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- Evaluating models using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

### 5. Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV  
- Cross-validation for performance reliability  
- Comparison of model accuracy and generalization
